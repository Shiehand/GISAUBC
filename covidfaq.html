				Does the pneumonia vaccine shield you from the coronavirus?
			</button>
			<div class="content">
				No. The pneumonia vaccine, like other vaccines (pneumococcus and
				Haemophilus influenzae type B) do not provide protection from
				the COVID-19 virus. This virus is new and different which
				requires time to create a specific vaccine for. Researchers are
				constantly trying to develop a vaccine to tackle COVID-19 and
				WHO is providing enormous support to make it happen. Even though
				this vaccine is not effective towards COVID-19, vaccines created
				to provide protection from respiratory diseases are very
				recommended to keep your health in check.

			<div class="content">
				It has not been confirmed how long the virus can last on
				objects, but it shares similarities with other types of
				coronavirus. Researchers show that the virus can stay for a few
				hours until a few days. The duration itself can be affected by
				external factors such as the surface type and temperature. If
				you feel that a surface may be infected, ensure to clean it with
				a disinfectant. Remember to clean your hands after doing so with
				alcohol-based hand rub or soap with water. Avoid touching your
				eyes, nose or mouth.

			</button>
			<div class="content">

				your hands frequently with soap and running water or
				alcohol-based hand rub. Furthermore, avoid contact from those

				to confirm if an individual caught the virus, they can take
				frequent tests. Throughout isolation, individuals must follow
				all the instructions from healthcare workers to minimize the
				spread of the virus.

					declares whether or not you are infected by COVID-19 virus.

					not have to do the test again in Indonesia. If you decided
